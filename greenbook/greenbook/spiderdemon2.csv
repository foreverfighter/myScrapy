Welcome to the world of Bürkert Fluid Control Systems.




Bürkert is one of the world's leading manufacturers of measurement and control systems for liquids and gases.




The leading partner in fluid control systems




For 70 years, we at Bürkert have been devoting a lot of time and energy to liquids and gases.




And yet hardly a day goes by without new and exciting challenges which we gladly embrace — challenges that help us grow. Whether measuring or controlling, we’re fascinated by everything that flows. And without doubt, this fascination has enabled us to become a world leader in the area of Fluid Control Systems. It also drives us to constantly reinvent ourselves without losing sight of our strong values.




Process Organisation




Our efforts have created a flexible organization that is evolving every day thanks to its closeness to our customers. It is a closeness that is second nature to us as a medium-sized company. Bürkert’s expanding global network, combined with the constant optimization of our processes across all segments, allows us to exchange experience directly and develop joint solutions more quickly and effectively.




System solutions




This fascination for our business also motivates us to continue venturing beyond the confines of specific market sectors and to seek exceptional solutions to unconventional problems. The segmentation of markets is one example of the specific courage at Bürkert to diverge from standards. This allows us to deliver maximum customer benefit, especially when it comes to application-oriented system solutions, without losing sight of our product-based solutions. Is there anything more fascinating than that? Let us fuel your fascination, too. Welcome to Bürkert!

History




Jimmy S.T. Lau founded a wholesale abrasive and distribution business in Petaling Jaya in 1975 after securing the exclusive distribution rights to Norton Abrasive Company, U.S.A. in Malaysia. He established the company to provide efficient grinding and sanding solutions to the wood and metal working sector. In 1979, he set up CBA Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. as a conversion plant to cater to the growing demand of local industries. With this plant, CBA is able to maintain competitiveness and shorten delivery lead time of sanding belts from 3 months to 3 working days.




In 1985, Norton Abrasive Co., U.S.A. awarded him the distribution rights to Singapore, thus United CBA Pte. Ltd. was incorporated that year. The distributorship in Singapore provided the base for him to source more agencies to add to CBA’s portfolio. Ridge Tool Company awarded CBA the exclusive distribution rights in 1989 to distribute their renowned pipe working tools and drain cleaning machines under the brand Ridgid and Ridgid/Kollmann in Malaysia. Their high quality threading machines and pipe wrenches enable us to service several new market sectors namely the oil & gas, piping construction and plumbing.




Through carefully managed expansion programme, he is constantly seeking new agencies and ventures to expand our products and services to meet industries demands, to be industries’ preferred industrial supplier.

Doctor Doors Gallery

 is incorporated since 2006 with a vision to innovate safe and quality products for residential, commercial and industrial developments.




 




With just 7 years of industry experience, Doctor Doors Gallery has gradually emerge as a market leader in fabricating aluminium window grilles, wrought iron gates, tempered glass, glass panel and wooden doors. With our innovative ideas, we have conceptualised our products ranging from Combi Door to Glass Curtains to suit the constraint space at an affordable price.




 




We have also built a team of experienced and dedicated staff along the way, to provide solutions and quality service that exceeds our clients' expectations.




At Doctor Doors Gallery, any wrought iron product can be customised to meet the needs of clients. With a team of highly skilled artisans, only the best quality of wrought iron is produced, where high standards are constantly pursued. With a durable coating applied after fabrication, a lasting and rust-free piece is completed. Every stroke of paint is applied by hand, and hence, each piece of wrought iron is unique in terms of the brushing strokes and appearance.




In addition, durable, low maintenance, environmental-friendly, space-saving, functional and high quality carpentry work is produced daily, where meticulous details and flawless finishing are discovered in all of our products. Our designers and craftsmen use only premium materials, and coupled with their skills, even the smallest piece of product would be crafted and built to perfection. 




Through intense heating and rapid cooling, tempered glass is manufactured, which makes it harder and stronger than normal glass. Customisation works such as cutting, grinding and hole-drilling on the glass have to be done prior to tempering. With years of experience in both commercial and residential projects, we have helped many owners in beautifying their homes and stores by setting up tempered glass panels for places such as balcony and staircase railings, shower screens and many other customised designs.




Furthermore, our rubbish chutes are made from the finest stainless steel, and is fire, scratch and dent resistant. The air tight function helps to prevent odour and theft entry. On top of it all, it is resistant to corrosion of food and beverage, and comes with a flush design, with self-locking ability.




Consequently, with the invention of Combi Door, this is a combination of a gate with a door that open inwards, homes are made simpler. Only one key is required to open the door, yet all safety features are incorporated. The gate is made from solid iron while the customised laminated wooden door offers a modern look, with the option of fire-rated or non-fire-rated door. The in-house designed and manufactured hinge also helps to prevent burglary. The unique feature of the Combi Door which opens inwards helps to solve the problem of blocking walkways like the conventional gate. This is an extremely user friendly feature for the elderly and wheel-chair bound individuals.




Moreover, with the introduction of Combi Fold, there is an alternative to bedroom and bathroom doors. Combi Fold is scratch resistant and water proof, and can turn 180 degrees. By fully folding the door into half, a mechanism will unlock and the Combi Fold door can then be opened fully. Made from high compressed laminates and aluminium profile, it can be easily maintained. Available in 2 colours, the frame of the door can also be powder coated to a similar colour as the laminates.




With Doctor Doors Gallery being the sole distributor of Glass Curtains, unobstructed panoramic view can be enjoyed, where dust and pollution can be easily prevented, and is suitable for all kinds of weather. With the panels folding inwards allowing easy access, it is safe and easy to clean. Say goodbye to messy construction work and noise, and enjoy the outdoors or balcony in pure comfort. With Glass Curtains™, the space of your house is fully utilised, making it more spacious and beautiful.




At Doctor Doors Gallery, our products are built to ensure lasting enjoyment and pride.
