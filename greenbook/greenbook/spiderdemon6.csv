Recently with increased demand for soundproofing service in asia it was inevitable to develop soundproofing Asia. Singapore was chosen as it has could be said the largest port in the world and is perfect for import and shipping. The other main reason is that Singapore is in a key location and very close to all the surrounding country's.





Our soundproofing products are carefully selected and designed for the specific region in which we cover. It is important that when you buy soundproofing products they are climateized and will operate in the conditions of the area.
NoiseStop Systems Singapore Product range is slightly different in the make-up of the products and composition to help give better performance in the climate of Asia.

History




Jimmy S.T. Lau founded a wholesale abrasive and distribution business in Petaling Jaya in 1975 after securing the exclusive distribution rights to Norton Abrasive Company, U.S.A. in Malaysia. He established the company to provide efficient grinding and sanding solutions to the wood and metal working sector. In 1979, he set up CBA Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. as a conversion plant to cater to the growing demand of local industries. With this plant, CBA is able to maintain competitiveness and shorten delivery lead time of sanding belts from 3 months to 3 working days.




In 1985, Norton Abrasive Co., U.S.A. awarded him the distribution rights to Singapore, thus United CBA Pte. Ltd. was incorporated that year. The distributorship in Singapore provided the base for him to source more agencies to add to CBA’s portfolio. Ridge Tool Company awarded CBA the exclusive distribution rights in 1989 to distribute their renowned pipe working tools and drain cleaning machines under the brand Ridgid and Ridgid/Kollmann in Malaysia. Their high quality threading machines and pipe wrenches enable us to service several new market sectors namely the oil & gas, piping construction and plumbing.

It intends to leverage on the experience of its parent company, ANGLO-SIMA Janitorial Supplies Pte Ltd headquartered in Singapore since 1981, by introducing quality, innovative and ergonomic products at the most competitive price available.
 
The ability to offer price savings to our strong network of distributors throughout Malaysia is demonstrated by our capability in bulk purchasing and resourcefulness in our vast supplier networks in United States, Europe and across the Asia Pacific. 
 
Our foray into Malaysia has enabled us to be closer to all our customers by offering a complete range of machinery, stocking alternatives, the availability and constant supply of spare parts, prompt and reliable after sales service and importantly, our expertise in solving issues professionally and promptly.
 
CLEANTOOLS (TH) Co. Ltd was launched in Thailand in 2006 with similar business direction as that in Malaysia.
 
As the business gained more momentum, CLEANTOOLS expanded into Singapore with CLEANTOOLS (S) Pte Ltd in 2008.

Doctor Doors Gallery

 is incorporated since 2006 with a vision to innovate safe and quality products for residential, commercial and industrial developments.




 




With just 7 years of industry experience, Doctor Doors Gallery has gradually emerge as a market leader in fabricating aluminium window grilles, wrought iron gates, tempered glass, glass panel and wooden doors. With our innovative ideas, we have conceptualised our products ranging from Combi Door to Glass Curtains to suit the constraint space at an affordable price.




 




We have also built a team of experienced and dedicated staff along the way, to provide solutions and quality service that exceeds our clients' expectations.




At Doctor Doors Gallery, any wrought iron product can be customised to meet the needs of clients. With a team of highly skilled artisans, only the best quality of wrought iron is produced, where high standards are constantly pursued. With a durable coating applied after fabrication, a lasting and rust-free piece is completed. Every stroke of paint is applied by hand, and hence, each piece of wrought iron is unique in terms of the brushing strokes and appearance.




In addition, durable, low maintenance, environmental-friendly, space-saving, functional and high quality carpentry work is produced daily, where meticulous details and flawless finishing are discovered in all of our products. Our designers and craftsmen use only premium materials, and coupled with their skills, even the smallest piece of product would be crafted and built to perfection. 




Through intense heating and rapid cooling, tempered glass is manufactured, which makes it harder and stronger than normal glass. Customisation works such as cutting, grinding and hole-drilling on the glass have to be done prior to tempering. With years of experience in both commercial and residential projects, we have helped many owners in beautifying their homes and stores by setting up tempered glass panels for places such as balcony and staircase railings, shower screens and many other customised designs.




Furthermore, our rubbish chutes are made from the finest stainless steel, and is fire, scratch and dent resistant. The air tight function helps to prevent odour and theft entry. On top of it all, it is resistant to corrosion of food and beverage, and comes with a flush design, with self-locking ability.




Consequently, with the invention of Combi Door, this is a combination of a gate with a door that open inwards, homes are made simpler. Only one key is required to open the door, yet all safety features are incorporated. The gate is made from solid iron while the customised laminated wooden door offers a modern look, with the option of fire-rated or non-fire-rated door. The in-house designed and manufactured hinge also helps to prevent burglary. The unique feature of the Combi Door which opens inwards helps to solve the problem of blocking walkways like the conventional gate. This is an extremely user friendly feature for the elderly and wheel-chair bound individuals.




Moreover, with the introduction of Combi Fold, there is an alternative to bedroom and bathroom doors. Combi Fold is scratch resistant and water proof, and can turn 180 degrees. By fully folding the door into half, a mechanism will unlock and the Combi Fold door can then be opened fully. Made from high compressed laminates and aluminium profile, it can be easily maintained. Available in 2 colours, the frame of the door can also be powder coated to a similar colour as the laminates.




With Doctor Doors Gallery being the sole distributor of Glass Curtains, unobstructed panoramic view can be enjoyed, where dust and pollution can be easily prevented, and is suitable for all kinds of weather. With the panels folding inwards allowing easy access, it is safe and easy to clean. Say goodbye to messy construction work and noise, and enjoy the outdoors or balcony in pure comfort. With Glass Curtains™, the space of your house is fully utilised, making it more spacious and beautiful.




At Doctor Doors Gallery, our products are built to ensure lasting enjoyment and pride.

KIAN SENG HARDWARE TRADING PTE LTD

 starts as a sole proprietorship under the business name of Kian Seng Trading Company in 1972. It had a humble beginning, but within a short period, it has grown to a million dollar business which warrants its conversion into a private limited company on 18 May 1981. Since then, we have grown steadily spreading to cover the neighbouring countries and are now the agents and representatives of many well known products.

DWT

 is a family owned company, located in the industrial heart of Germany. The headquarter is situated in Bottrop, where production and central stock is located. The company has been set up in the year 1987 as main supplier of the german mining companies. Nowadays we deliver products all over the world to different markets and for many different applications. Since 2002 DWT built up the export business by focusing more on the pipe beveling and cutting market. Nowadays application engineers with sale & service offices are located in Brazil, China, Malaysia, India, UAE and Russia, to support our fast growing business all over the world. Ten years ago DWT has overtaken the production of pipe beveling machines from the German steam boiler manufacturer „Deutsche Babcock“, who has developed the machines for the need and with the experience of their own people on-site. The advantages were obvious due to very low weight, high degree of flexibility and capacity. The machines are designed for a long lifetime with low spare part need and ergonomic use on-site.

Its parent company started out as supplier of paints, chemicals and other essentials to the many junkets and boats that where stationed along the busy Singapore river. In the later years, as the number of boats were reduced, the parent company diversified into the supply of household paints and supplies to meet the fast growing Singapore population. With the introduction of public housing in HDB estates, the company soon became involved totally with the sales and distribution of household paints and supplies.

Sheet Metal International Systems Pte Ltd

, Singapore was set-up in 1992 and is presently headed by its Managing Director, Karl Seuffert since 1995. Karl, a fourth-generation metal roofer, is a Certified Master Craftsman with more than 30 years experience in the metal roofing business. He has been responsible for many projects in the Europe , the middle-East and Asia, and on many occasions being responsible for the design, fabrication and installation of complex roofs.

 




Together with a well organized office headed by Ms. Gertrude Charles, the rest of the Singapore team is made up of highly skilled European Journeymen, Craftsmen or Supervisors as they are known in this trade, each with a minimum working experience of 10 years in the metal roofing industry. For larger projects, additional Journeymen from Europe can supplement this crew. This gives the company flexibility to manage a myriad of undertakings, from small simpler tasks to the larger complex projects. All work adheres strictly to the quality standards of the German Metal Roofing Association in Germany which is similar to the SMACNA Technical Manual and British Standards.

 




All shop drawings and technical details are done in-house with close coordination between the architects and/or main contractors. Our workshop has well-maintained machines and tools that are necessary for the fabrication and installation of this type of highly specialized metal roofing works.

 




Our Custom-Made Seaming Techniques:




• Double Standing Seam Roofing

• Batten Seam Roofing

• Shingle Seam Cladding

 




These traditional techniques for roof and wall claddings have existed for many centuries in Europe and are tailor-made systems with almost unlimited design possibilities. With the correct application, proper installation and workmanship, these cladding systems are able to withstand the most severe weather conditions and can last more than a lifetime. A fine example of these techniques could be seen in all the old beautiful buildings in Europe with metal roof and wall claddings. Typically, this system can be applied to nearly any kind of metal, from copper, titanium zinc, aluminium, stainless steel to pure titanium, available in either flat sheets or coils. This provides architects, developers and contractors a comprehensive source to plan their most sophisticated roof and wall cladding projects.

                                            DYNAGLASS REINFORCED PLASTIC PTE LTD is a fast growing company with strong technological base in the area of engineered reinforced plastic. Since our inception in 1971, our company quickly became the leader in the development and manufacture of high performance moulded ‘fibreglass’ products in Singapore and the regions around. Backed by this expertise in technology and high standard of quality, we have built a clientele that associates workable fibreglass reinforced plastic products.



In addition to existing facility over 7,000 square meter of space, we have added another 552 square meter (6,000 square feet) of production space.



With 38 years in the fiber reinforced plastic composite technology, Dynaglass manufactures finished products and services for the following industry segments:



BUILDING


PROCESS


ECO-GREEN


OFFSHORE & MARINE


OTHERS



As Dynaglass continues to thrive, we are exposed to the many hi-tech manufacturing processes and exotic materials readily available in the advance composite industry today. The composit industry is slightly over 40 years old and we have been around for the past 38 years.



One could say that we have been groomed into the industry. Afterall we have come a long way from the ‘Stone Age’, ‘Iron Age’, ‘Aluminium Age’ and now with development of advance composites in automotive, aerospace and aviation. Today, advance composite materials like carbon fiber, hybrid fibers, ceramic fibres, matrix fibres such as Kevlar, marks the dawning of the ‘Composite Age’.
Our future lies in “putting it in a nut shell’, integrating the Company’s widely diverse expertise to manufacture products that will solve ‘problems’ for our customers.

Process Organisation




Our efforts have created a flexible organization that is evolving every day thanks to its closeness to our customers. It is a closeness that is second nature to us as a medium-sized company.

System solutions




This fascination for our business also motivates us to continue venturing beyond the confines of specific market sectors and to seek exceptional solutions to unconventional problems. The segmentation of markets is one example of the specific courage at Bürkert to diverge from standards. This allows us to deliver maximum customer benefit, especially when it comes to application-oriented system solutions, without losing sight of our product-based solutions.
