Lau founded a wholesale abrasive and distribution business in Petaling Jaya in 1975 after securing the exclusive distribution rights to Norton Abrasive Company, U.S.A. in Malaysia. He established the company to provide efficient grinding and sanding solutions to the wood and metal working sector. In 1979, he set up CBA Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. as a conversion plant to cater to the growing demand of local industries. With this plant, CBA is able to maintain competitiveness and shorten delivery lead time of sanding belts from 3 months to 3 working days.\n\n\r\n\n\nIn 1985, Norton Abrasive Co., U.S.A. awarded him the distribution rights to Singapore, thus United CBA Pte. Ltd. was incorporated that year. The distributorship in Singapore provided the base for him to source more agencies to add to CBA’s portfolio. Ridge Tool Company awarded CBA the exclusive distribution rights in 1989 to distribute their renowned pipe working tools and drain cleaning machines under the brand Ridgid and Ridgid/Kollmann in Malaysia. Their high quality threading machines and pipe wrenches enable us to service several new market sectors namely the oil & gas, piping construction and plumbing.\n\n\r\n\n\nThrough carefully managed expansion programme, he is constantly seeking new agencies and ventures to expand our products and services to meet industries demands, to be industries’ preferred industrial supplier.\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nProducts & Services\n\n\r\n\n\nCBA Industries Pte Ltd works with renowned suppliers in the specific field to provide customers with quality products at affordable prices from categories including:\n\n\r\n\n\nAbrasives for Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (MRO)\n\nAdhesives, Lubricants & Sealants\n\nPiping & Tubing related Tools\n\nDegreaser & Cleaning Products\n\nPersonal Protection Equipment & Clothing\n\nPower Tool Accessories\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nCustomers\n\n\r\n\n\nCBA’s diverse customer base is comprised of professionals from businesses and institutions of all sizes, Government customers include technical schools and institutions on the state and national levels.

With our innovative ideas, we have conceptualised our products ranging from Combi Door to Glass Curtains to suit the constraint space at an affordable price.\n\n\r\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nWe have also built a team of experienced and dedicated staff along the way, to provide solutions and quality service that exceeds our clients' expectations.\n\n\r\n\n\nAt Doctor Doors Gallery, any wrought iron product can be customised to meet the needs of clients. With a team of highly skilled artisans, only the best quality of wrought iron is produced, where high standards are constantly pursued. With a durable coating applied after fabrication, a lasting and rust-free piece is completed. Every stroke of paint is applied by hand, and hence, each piece of wrought iron is unique in terms of the brushing strokes and appearance.\n\n\r\n\n\nIn addition, durable, low maintenance, environmental-friendly, space-saving, functional and high quality carpentry work is produced daily, where meticulous details and flawless finishing are discovered in all of our products. Our designers and craftsmen use only premium materials, and coupled with their skills, even the smallest piece of product would be crafted and built to perfection.\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nThrough intense heating and rapid cooling, tempered glass is manufactured, which makes it harder and stronger than normal glass. Customisation works such as cutting, grinding and hole-drilling on the glass have to be done prior to tempering. With years of experience in both commercial and residential projects, we have helped many owners in beautifying their homes and stores by setting up tempered glass panels for places such as balcony and staircase railings, shower screens and many other customised designs.\n\n\r\n\n\nFurthermore, our rubbish chutes are made from the finest stainless steel, and is fire, scratch and dent resistant. The air tight function helps to prevent odour and theft entry.\xa0On top of it all, it is resistant to corrosion of food and beverage, and comes with a flush design, with self-locking ability.\n\n\r\n\n\nConsequently, with the invention of Combi Door, this is a combination of a gate with a door that open inwards, homes are made simpler.\xa0Only one key is required to open the door, yet all safety features are incorporated. The gate is made from solid iron while the customised laminated wooden door offers a modern look, with the option of fire-rated or non-fire-rated door. The in-house designed and manufactured hinge also helps to prevent burglary.\xa0The unique feature of the Combi Door which opens inwards helps to solve the problem of blocking walkways like the conventional gate.

Karl, a fourth-generation metal roofer, is a Certified Master Craftsman with more than 30 years experience in the metal roofing business. He has been responsible for many projects in the Europe , the middle-East and Asia, and on many occasions being responsible for the design, fabrication and installation of complex roofs.\n\n\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nTogether with a well organized office headed by Ms. Gertrude Charles, the rest of the Singapore team is made up of highly skilled European Journeymen, Craftsmen or Supervisors as they are known in this trade, each with a minimum working experience of 10 years in the metal roofing industry. For larger projects, additional Journeymen from Europe can supplement this crew. This gives the company flexibility to manage a myriad of undertakings, from small simpler tasks to the larger complex projects. All work adheres strictly to the quality standards of the German Metal Roofing Association in Germany which is similar to the SMACNA Technical Manual and British Standards.\n\n\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nAll shop drawings and technical details are done in-house with close coordination between the architects and/or main contractors. Our workshop has well-maintained machines and tools that are necessary for the fabrication and installation of this type of highly specialized metal roofing works.\n\n\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nOur Custom-Made Seaming Techniques:\n\n\r\n\n\n• Double Standing Seam Roofing\n\n• Batten Seam Roofing\n\n• Shingle Seam Cladding\n\n\xa0\n\n\r\n\n\nThese traditional techniques for roof and wall claddings have existed for many centuries in Europe and are tailor-made systems with almost unlimited design possibilities. With the correct application, proper installation and workmanship, these cladding systems are able to withstand the most severe weather conditions and can last more than a lifetime.

Since our inception in 1971, our company quickly became the leader in the development and manufacture of high performance moulded ‘fibreglass’ products in Singapore and the regions around. Backed by this expertise in technology and high standard of quality, we have built a clientele that associates workable fibreglass reinforced plastic products.\r\n\n\n\r\nIn addition to existing facility over 7,000 square meter of space, we have added another 552 square meter (6,000 square feet) of production space.\r\n\n\n\r\nWith 38 years in the fiber reinforced plastic composite technology, Dynaglass manufactures finished products and services for the following industry segments:\r\n\n\n\r\nBUILDING\n\n\r\nPROCESS\n\n\r\nECO-GREEN\n\n\r\nOFFSHORE & MARINE\n\n\r\nOTHERS\n\n\r\n\r\nAs Dynaglass continues to thrive, we are exposed to the many hi-tech manufacturing processes and exotic materials readily available in the advance composite industry today. The composit industry is slightly over 40 years old and we have been around for the past 38 years.\r\n\n\n\r\nOne could say that we have been groomed into the industry. Afterall we have come a long way from the ‘Stone Age’, ‘Iron Age’, ‘Aluminium Age’ and now with development of advance composites in automotive, aerospace and aviation. Today, advance composite materials like carbon fiber, hybrid fibers, ceramic fibres, matrix fibres such as Kevlar, marks the dawning of the ‘Composite Age’.\r\nOur future lies in “putting it in a nut shell’, integrating the Company’s widely diverse expertise to manufacture products that will solve ‘problems’ for our customers.\r\n                                        \n\n\r\n                                    ', 'FAILMSG': '', 'BIGCAT': 'http://www.thegreenbook.com/products/search/architect-builder-contractor-guides/', 'SMALLCAT': 'http://www.thegreenbook.com/products/wall-panels/'}
