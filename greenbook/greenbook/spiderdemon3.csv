Recently with increased demand for soundproofing service in asia it was inevitable to develop soundproofing Asia. Singapore was chosen as it has could be said the largest port in the world and is perfect for import and shipping. The other main reason is that Singapore is in a key location and very close to all the surrounding country's.





Our soundproofing products are carefully selected and designed for the specific region in which we cover. It is important that when you buy soundproofing products they are climateized and will operate in the conditions of the area.
NoiseStop Systems Singapore Product range is slightly different in the make-up of the products and composition to help give better performance in the climate of Asia.

Absolute Instrument Systems (Pte.) Ltd.

 – AIS - is one of the leading companies in Environmental noise and vibration monitoring technologies. Our success is driven by the support from our customers, and our people’s commitment to innovate, and finding solutions that meets the needs of our users.

Since 2007, after more than 17 years of experience in the field of scientific equipment, acoustics and vibration measurements, the founders of AIS introduced the widespread use of our custom-built wireless modem technologies in environmental noise monitoring, vibration monitoring, silty-water discharge, and CCTV monitoring to various users, including construction sites. These have eliminated the need to deploy manpower in collection of data, and dramatically improved the efforts in pollution control, due to the almost real-time monitoring information and alerts.

AIS continues to focus on applying our knowledge, skills and experience in providing reliable, innovative technologies, and competent technical support to our pool of loyal customers and users, so that they can benefit, and acquire a competitive edge for their organisations.

In 2010, Absolute Laboratories Pte. Ltd., - AL - an affiliated company to AIS, was formed to provide specialised and traceable calibration services for sound level meters and vibration monitors. AL is a manufacturer’s Authorised Service Centre for our region, and is currently undergoing the process of being accredited to ISO 17025 standards. This process will be completed by the first quarter of 2014. ALalso provides noise monitoring, noise control products and training services to our industrial customers.

In the region, AIS works with a network of trusted resellers, and in 2013, incorporated Absolute Instrument Sdn. Bhd. – AIS Malaysia - to expand and provide the same level of support to our users and partners.

At the heart of our operations, it has and always will be our people that make a difference in being committed, competent and aspire to perform. The AIS group of companies aspires to be the employer of choice for this group of individuals, by embarking on growth strategies that look intopersonnel’s potential and growth, work-life balance, and caring for our communities.

History




Jimmy S.T. Lau founded a wholesale abrasive and distribution business in Petaling Jaya in 1975 after securing the exclusive distribution rights to Norton Abrasive Company, U.S.A. in Malaysia. He established the company to provide efficient grinding and sanding solutions to the wood and metal working sector. In 1979, he set up CBA Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. as a conversion plant to cater to the growing demand of local industries. With this plant, CBA is able to maintain competitiveness and shorten delivery lead time of sanding belts from 3 months to 3 working days.




In 1985, Norton Abrasive Co., U.S.A. awarded him the distribution rights to Singapore, thus United CBA Pte. Ltd. was incorporated that year. The distributorship in Singapore provided the base for him to source more agencies to add to CBA’s portfolio. Ridge Tool Company awarded CBA the exclusive distribution rights in 1989 to distribute their renowned pipe working tools and drain cleaning machines under the brand Ridgid and Ridgid/Kollmann in Malaysia. Their high quality threading machines and pipe wrenches enable us to service several new market sectors namely the oil & gas, piping construction and plumbing.




Through carefully managed expansion programme, he is constantly seeking new agencies and ventures to expand our products and services to meet industries demands, to be industries’ preferred industrial supplier.
