Sundays",+ 65 66940807,,"There are few things as sexy and seductive in the culinary world as a bright red lobster.  But like a lot of politicians, they tend to over-promise and under-deliver.  How many times have you eaten lobster and gone away thinking that you paid a lot of money just to look at a beautiful shell while the meat itself was nothing  to rave about? When was the last time you really experienced a lobster’s rich, briny, sweet, crustacean flavour?  You know the kind of full on flavour that you find in a great lobster bisque which is missing in a cold, boiled lobster? The real treasure of the lobster lies in the head where the tomally (liver) is as well as in the shell which contain carotenoid pigments.  These are the pigments that turn from green to red when the lobster is cooked and is a good indicator of flavour power! The actual meat from tail is mild tasting and lacks that flavour punch that is released only when you cook the shell. I guess that is why I wasn’t really swept up in the whole lobster roll craze last year.  The last time I ate a lobster sandwich was at
which was a little  seafood shack in Boston famous for its lobster sandwich.  It was good but not so good that it would be the one thing I must eat again on my next trip to Boston. That all changed when I tasted the lobster roll at The Naked Finn.  Ken Loon had told me about his lobster roll since he introduced it last year, but it wasn’t until I saw that it was listed as the best lobster roll in the
that I thought it is time to see what the fuss was all about. Most of the lobster rolls that we are familiar with are cold lobster rolls which is the version popular in Maine.  With this version, cold lobster meat is tossed in mayonnaise and served in a warm buttered bun.  In Connecticut where the
, there are actually two versions.  A warm lobster roll and a cold version known as a lobster salad roll. Naked Finn serves a warm lobster roll because my crusty friend, Ken Loon knows that you can only tease the flavour out of a lobster by using the high heat from a cast iron hot plate.  Those carotenoid pigments turns the butter into a fiery orangey red oil packed with intense lobster flavour.   Ken Loon only uses live maine lobsters and dispatches the lobster only when the orders come in. The bread is a locally sourced soft bun with a thin, light crust which is lightly buttered on the outside and toasted on the hot plate.  Once the lobster meat is ready, it is quickly tossed in a bit of home made mayonnaise and stuffed into the bun.  It might sound simple but when you get the simple things right, the result is simply out of this world!

The Lobster Roll at The Naked Finn is not your typical cold lobster sandwich!  If you have eaten cold lobster sandwich and went away wondering why you spent all that money, then The Naked Finn’s warm lobster sandwich might just change your mind!  $29 is expensive for a sandwich  but as far as lobster sandwiches go, it is pretty much mid range.  (prices across Singapore range from $19.90 to $49.90).  My only grouse is that the sandwich leaves me just half full and craving another one!"

Opening hours:

I think it has a lot to do with not just the quality, but more importantly, the perceived value of the meals there. Aside from just presenting the selection of Sushi, you can expect some hot items, side dishes and other surprises in between. What that means is that you won’t be heading for a plate of Hokkien Mee after signing away half a week’s pay there. Dinner will set you back at least $300 while the lunch sets start at $80. When I was there, a friend of mine ordered the $120 set and it came with a whole Uni in the shell. My $250 Omakase lunch set includes all the dishes you see in the blog, plus another sashimi dish which featured marinated Bonito, Tako and Ishiaki and dessert. No one would argue that if you want the ultimate Sushi experience, you need to eat in Japan. But when you have a craving and little time to fly there, then Hashida is a pretty good alternative."

I would honestly say that if I went to my favourite Lor Mee stall at Bukit Purmei and bought a $3 bowl with an additional $3 of extra ingredients, I would probably be just as happy. But if you compared this $15 bowl of Lor Mee alongside a $15 bowl of Ramen, then perhaps you would feel a little more justified. Personally, I think that it is the gravy that makes this Lor Mee different from the others. Cod Fish is great, but I can’t say that I prefer it over Shark meat enough to fork out such a big difference. As far as I know, no one else has come up with a $15 bowl of Lor Mee yet. So it is a first. Perhaps, it would serve as a catalyst to usher in the specialty Lor Mee stall just like how
did with Prawn Mee?"

I think that if their Ramen were priced at $13 per bowl and if Shigemi Kawahara weren’t three times Ramen Champion and the Ramen King, most people won’t be complaining. I don’t think being more expensive is the problem. I think the problem is that Singaporeans want an Ippudo Ramen that is exactly the same as what we can get in Japan and anything less is a disappointment. From what I know of the history of Ippudo, a man like Shigemi Kawahara will not satisfied until he is the undisputed King of Ramen in Singapore as well so there should be better things ahead!"

Using Wagyu is great as the flavour is very good.  But they really should just learn from Intel and label their pies “Wagyu inside” but just stick to the $4 price tag.  Then it would be compelling enough for people to want to drive to an Ulu part of Siglap to partake of the pie.

Ever wondered what the big fuss is over Mao Shan Wang?  Or what is the difference between XO and D24?  Or whether you can eat Hong Xia (lit Red Prawn) if you are allergic to prawns?  There are now so many branded Durians out there that there should be Durian appreciation courses just like what we do with wine!  I think it’s all to common that when Singaporeans eat Durians, the main concern is about where to go so that they don’t get cheated.  A lot of times, you  either need to know a trusted Durian seller or know someone who does.  Why can’t there simply be a place where you can buy good Durians at an honest price?

However, I have a feeling the Prawn Noodles were just a bit lack lustre that day and might usually be much better. There were quite a few people eating there on a late afternoon, so there must be something going for it.

The vegetarian foods that I have taken so far have been from those found in food courts. I must say that this is much better then those hawker ones because the hawker ones mostly use gluten in their mock meats. The “meats” here can be differentiated. The cooking is pretty good and the sauces were nice. I wouldn’t mind eating here again when I feel the need to lower my cholesterol intake.

With more and more stalls starting to make their own bean curd on the premises, the factory made bean curd has (for me at least) become what Kong Guan Bao is to Handmade Paus. If there are two bean curd stalls at the same food centre selling bean curd, and one is freshly made, I would gladly pay the 40 cents more for a bowl.
What I like about freshly made bean curd is that the texture of the beancurd is usually finer and smoother than the factory made version. This one is no exception. The texture is really smooth and it does not taste watered down. Nowadays they don’t need to use plaster of paris anymore. There are new chemical additives that they can use to turn soyabean milk into beancurd (like fruit pectin). The ginko nuts were all freshly prepared with the bitter bit in the middle removed. Quite Shiok after all that food that we ate.

They are very generous with the peanuts in the peanut soup here. The Ah Balling are also (I am told) handmade at home.

This is my idea of what a great char siew should be like. Thickly cut, tender, marbled and juicy meat with nicely charred and caramelised bits of fat on the outside. When you bite into the char siew, not only should it melt in your mouth, but, at the same time you should be able to appreciate the smell of smoking charcoal. Char Siew doesn’t get better then this!
For those who are inversely horizontally challenged (ie watching your weight), do not despair as you can have a choice of both lean and marbled versions of char siew.
The Char Siew is dipped intermittently during the roasting process in this marinade of soy sauce, sugar, oyster sauce and tau chio (salted bean paste) to ensure that a thick, translucent, caramelized layer coats the outside of the Char Siew. The importance of the cut and source of pork cannot be underestimated. Fatty Cheong uses only pork collar/shoulder meat from Brazil. This cut of meat has good marbling and level of fat to ensure that the Char Siew comes out tender and juicy.
Ever wondered what a Char Siew Sauna er.. Oven looks like? Charcoal ensures that the pork gets that characteristic flavour. Don’t bother to do this at home in the oven, it is never the same. By the way, I learnt that the process of making Sio Bak is amazingly simple. Pork Belly is marinated in salt, sugar and five spice powder for just over an hour and placed into the oven. Mr Cheong assures me that that is all that is needed to make the skin crispy.
Ta Da! Beautifully charred Char Siew fit for any five star restaurant.
I love the charred bits best! (But please eat in moderation ok?)
Now you know why the shop is called Fatty Cheong? Well it turns out that it may be a case of self fulfilling prophecy. When Mr Cheong started his shop 14 years ago, he was still a slim young man. I think he must have chosen the name Fatty cos he used to be an apprentice of the famous Fatty Ox HongKong BBQ. Since then, he has tweaked his Char Siew formula to suit the local taste. I must say that the disciple has a better char siew then the master, although Fatty Ox’s roast duck is still number one.
This is easily one of the best if not the best Char Siew in Singapore, and very reasonably priced. Certainly the current number one Char Siew in the ieatishootipost
. The Sio Bak and Roast Duck are both very good but it is the Char Siew that just has that extra something to keep you salivating while trying to get to bed.
Currently World’s 2nd Best Char Siew (We are still looking for the World’s Best). PS: At this stage, I must say that I have tasted a couple of great Char Siew that all rank very close to the top five best Char Siews. My feel is that at the end of the day, there might be a few which would have to be crowned World’s 2nd Best. We’ll see. Another thing, to enjoy really good char siew, you need to have at least a little fat. If you take it lean, don’t expect it to be that great."

Then I found out that they had run out of the A Grade Char Siew and what was left was the B Grade Char Siew! Phwa Lao Eh! (Good Heavens!) I had heard from the Bryan Wong show that the Char Siew was to die for. Dennis (The stall owner) explained to me that their Grade A Char Siew is made from Indonesian Pig Armpits (As if pigs have arms – they should be called legpits) and the meat is just really succulent and tender. They only use Indonesian Pork which is the more expensive but the best tasting pork, he told me that Malaysian and Australian pork just doesn’t cut it. So I had my B grade Char Siew Wontan mee. I found even the B grade Char Siew was already very good, so I am determined to return for the A Grade Armpit CharSiew next time. The noodles were good and they use a clear sauce to flavour the noodles so that it gives it just that hint of sweet and savouriness. But I think it is the Grade A Char Siew that is the star here. Skinnyfoodie did not think much of it, so you have to try it yourself to make a judgement.
I have to come back for Armpit Char Siew! ……… To be continued…

One of the forummers (bobafett) is even willing to stick out his neck to proclaim it the best fish porridge in Singapore! Uncle tells me that they use only good quality Knife Brand vegetable oil here and there is no pork lard used. The stock is also made purely from boiling the bones of the Batang (Mackeral). He would start boiling the soup from 5am in the morning and it would only be ready by 10am. For those more adventurous, you can also partake of the other parts of the fish like the eyes, head, stomach area, roe and the mail equivalent of roe. (Which I find very hard to put in writing)
You have to eat this piping hot because you don’t want to overcook the fish. The fish is very fresh and the meat is firm but still delicate. Unlike most other fish porridge I have eaten, this one comes without the skin, so you don’t get the Chow Chor (fishy odour) smell. The soup is really sweet and you can taste the quality and the effort that goes into the preparation. Even if you don’t like fish, you might still like this because it isn’t really fishy at all.
Yet another Teochew Ah Hia adament on using only the freshest ingredients! Again equally Hao Lian (Proud) about the quality of his food!
You don’t have to wait until you are feeling guilty about all the unhealthy stuff you have eaten whole week to eat this. This is healthy stuff that you can really enjoy and still feel that you have done your heart a favour after that.

This stall is one of those new rising stars, having been around for only 2 years, it has already got long queues and been in the Bryan Wong show. So I was fortunate to arrive after the peak period where I did not have to line up for my Lor Mee.
The special draw of the stall is of course its famous Shark’s Meat fritters which are added to the Lor Mee. Ah, at least now we are making use of the whole shark and not just the fins! If you ask me, I really don’t think shark’s meat is that unique in taste. It tastes much like any other white fish. But the Lor (sauce) is very tasty and they give lots of crispy crunchy stuff that is awesome with the Lor. I also really like their crispy meat fritters, very pang (savoury). This is how Lor Mee should be like: Crispy fried stuff drowned in a gooey tasty Lor! There are some things I miss though, like the braised pork, ngor hiang and braised egg.
Though its been a long time since I ate Lor Mee, this one really got my vote for one of the outstanding Lor Mees in Singapore.

What do you do? Well, you could turn on the computer, log onto ieatishootipost and check out the After 10 label. Then a big smile will come across your face when you discover this blog. Cos salvation is at hand! There is a Nasi Lemak place dishing out Nasi Lemak with a seriously shiok curry till 2 am!
I really liked Hainanese Style Curry Chicken Wings. The curry gravy is darn shiok and sure to satisfy your umami(savoury) craving. This place is also famous for its Black Chicken Wings. These are fried chicken wings coated with a sweet and savoury, Kecap Manis based sauce. The sauce is very shiok but I found the chicken wings a bit overcooked that night so it was a bit too dry.
The rice was fragrant, but not the best I have tasted. Sambal chilli was the sweeter version which I always prefer with my Nasi Lemak. Forummers have raved about the Petai (Topmost pic) but I don’t think I have developed a taste for it. I find it too bitter for my palate. All the curry dishes here are very very good. Aside from the curry chicken, the brinjal and the Sayur Lodeh (Mixed Veg Curry) were excellent. My only other complaint is that they don’t use a Bain-Marie to keep the food warm, so only the rice is warm. It would have been great if the curries were not cold.
Good place to satisfy your Nasi Lemak craving with some really excellent curries. Would have been perfect if the food was warm and the fried stuff were not over fried.

The duck was pretty ordinary and just did not have enough of the savoury five spice taste. The flesh was nice and tender though

Ever heard of Chi Kak Kueh? Neither have I, and I dare to pride myself as Teochew Ah Bah! (Half past six one only) I was just walking around Tekka Market Food Centre looking for stalls with Adrian Pang’s or Seethoh’s face on them. Amazingly, for such an established Food Centre, there were very few with newspaper cuttings. It was then that I chanced upon this stall and spied this unusually coloured Poong Tor (Rice Dumpling – or so I thought). Mom screamed with delight as if she just found her long lost son and got really excited. I found out later that the excitement was over this rare Teochew dessert whose colour is attributed to the Chi Kak leaves which you hardly buy in Singapore anymore.
The stall owners explained that the kuehs here are made by their 85 year old mother who does an annual pilgrimage to Swatow Province in China to buy back a year’s supply of Chi Kak leaves to make the Kueh. She wasn’t at the stall because she is at home busy making Kuehs for the next day. The Chi Kak gives the skin a distinctive flavour which is hard to describe except that it tastes a bit like Kee Chang (a type of Rice Dumpling). The filling is made from sweetened mashed green beans. Tastes a bit like Ang Ku Kweh, but we certainly did not strike lottery the next day (Hokkien Poem that says when you eat Hot Ang Ku Kweh, you will strike the lottery) I can’t honestly rate this because I have never tasted anything like it before so it is hard to make a fair judgement. Mom gave it a
cos she had tasted better ones before.
Aside from all the traditional Teochew Kuehs like Poong Tor (Rice Dumpling), Soon Kueh (Turnip filling) and Orh Kueh (Yam cake), they also steam their own Chai Tau Kuey (erronously known as Carrot Cake, it is made from Radish). Most stores nowadays buy theirs from a factory.
Tada! Plate of black carrot cake, everything made in this small little stall. You can taste the difference in the texture as well as the taste of the carrot cake itself. Otherwise, fried egg and black sauce tastes much the same everywhere.

Happy to have found yet another stall where our culinary heritage is still preserved. Worth a try if only to experience what a Chi Kak Kueh tastes like."

3.5/5","This is probably the best Roasted Meat Stall in the new Tiong Bahru Market and was recommended by the forummers. I think the best item here is the Sio Bak. For those concerned about their fat intake and cholesterol levels, you would be pleased to see that the pork here is pretty lean. I was impressed by the super crispy skin. They tell me that the crispiness is due to their technique of scouring the pork skin before it is roasted in a charcoal oven. The taste of the meat was also very good, leaving a Pang (savoury) smell which you can savour after you swallow the meat.

Their Char Siew was not sweet enough for me, but the meat was nice and tender, so readers who like a less sweet Char Siew might appreciate this.
. Not a big fan of the Roast Duck which was not even served with plum sauce. The flesh was tender but the taste was not exceptional.

Certainly worth a try if you are at Tiong Bahru Market and have a craving for Roast Meats."

Opening hours:
6:30AM to 11:00PM",90223037,,"This is the first of a six part series on the newly refurbished Tiong Bahru Market. Somehow the name Tiong Bahru is synonymous with yummy hawker fare. Last time, everybody wants to tag Tiong Bahru in front of their stall name when they moved out of Tiong Bahru (eg Tiong Bahru Pao). Now everybody in this Food Centre wants to tag Tiong Bahru in front of their stall names to show people that they have moved back to the new Tiong Bahru Food Centre. (It’s come full circle) The other thing you notice is that nobody bothers to tag other old food centres like “Bugis” or “Whampoa” in front of their names. It’s like Bugis cannot fight with the power of Tiong Bahru. Know what I mean? Indeed the old Tiong Bahru Market was famous for all the great eats and this Chwee Kueh was one of them.
Chwee Kueh is a very simple dish. Get some rice flour, mix with water and steam it. Then eat it with fried Chye Poh and chilli. So what’s the big deal and how come this stall has been selling just Chwee Kueh and nothing else for the last 50 years? I really like the texture of this Chwee Kueh. It is soft to the bite and you can basically eat it after you remove both upper and lower dentures. (No I don’t wear dentures) The texture sets it apart from all the other Chwee Kuehs I have eaten. I found out why. They still mill their own rice to make the flour that makes the Chwee Kueh! The second thing is that tasty fried chye poh. If you look closely, you will also notice the generous use of sesame seeds. Very pang (savoury) indeed!
One of the few original stalls from the old Tiong Bahru Market. If you like Chwee Kueh, you need to try this.

A good duck rice must have a good Lor (Gravy). As my mom would say “lose-win” is the Lor. Most of the time when I eat duck rice, I don’t actually go for the duck meat as I would with chicken when I eat chicken rice. I usually go for the Tau Pok (Fried Bean Curd) and the Lor with the rice. And if they have braised peanuts, it’s a bonus.
East Coast Lagoon Food Village seems hardly the place one would go for Braised Duck. To me the beach means Satay, Rojak, Hokkien Mee and Roti John. Braised Duck seems too melancholic for the beach. But hey, here was the store and there was a picture of Kim Ng and Fiona Xie eating the duck rice. Who am I to argue with the wonder twins?
The Lor is very good and overall, I like it. Its the thick and sticky type which is a little sweet and the herbs are not overpowering. Actually, I have to admit I am not a duck rice fanatic, so this one is as good a duck rice as I ever ate. However, I don’t think you’d drive all the way from Jurong to eat this, especially since they have branches elsewhere.

A good duck rice, but as I already alluded to, when you come to East Coast at night, you just want to eat something that is grilled over charcoal or put on a banana leaf. Know what I mean?

Hoe Nam has been in business a long long time. There is a good reason why. Their prawn noodle soup is very very tasty. They don’t have any gimmicks. You don’t find giant king prawns here. You just get your traditional Prawn Mee with options for Pork Ribs, Pig Tail and Abalone (Ok maybe the Abalone is not so traditional – I don’t know so please share if you do know) And best of all, the prices are not exorbitant. They start at $3 per bowl with quite a generous serving of medium sized, really nice and crunchy prawns. (I believe they use Thai Prawns which are fed better quality feed – also more expensive)
Why is the soup so good? The stallowners say it is because they sell so many bowls of prawn noodles a day, that they have to boil more prawns in the stock. More prawns, more taste. It’s that simple. Aside from prawns, the other main ingredient in the soup are the pork bones. The soup is simmered for over 24 hours to extract all the taste from the prawn and pork bones. Other ingredients? Bit of soy sauce and secret spice mix (I guess it will remain a secret).

Got there at almost 3pm and they have sold out most of their items. Aiya! Only able to taste the soup, a few fish balls and Tau Kee (Crispy Bean Sheets). I am not a big Yong Tau Foo man, so I’ve got to rely on ieatMaMa who loves the stuff to give her opinion.
If you want to eat great food, you have to look for hawkers who are passionate and proud of their heritage and cooking. There are a few types of hawkers nowadays. You have those in the food courts who are hired by a boss to run a stall, they won’t know nuts about the food. Then, you have hawker traders who merely buy stuff to sell, like most Tau Hway (Bean Curd) and Ngo Hiang (Prawn Fritters) stalls. Most of the highest rated hawkers are of the third category. They insist on having the best ingredients and most of the time, this means that they have to prepare most of the food from scratch.
So here’s the secret of this shop’s success. They make their own fish paste and insist on using the traditional Hang Zse Her (Yellow Tail) fish. The fish paste is then used to fill the Capsicums, Brinjal, Tau Pok, Okra etc. The water that the fish paste is soaked in is used to make the soup! Mmmmm, no wonder the soup is so nice. And the fish balls are exceptional! They are not overly bouncy, but have that authentic bite and tastes like unadulterated fish meat, which is what it really is.

Have to come one day to try the full menu! They have over 10 items that they make themselves, and it should not only be really tasty, but quite healthy too!

3.5/5","How not to try something that is both a Makansutra Legend as well as a place where
was taken to when he was in Singapore? It’s my first time trying Sup Tulang (Mutton Bone Marrow Soup). Oh, I have heard of it before, but somehow the thought of sucking out bone marrow did not quite thrill me. I mean, the only time I hear about bone marrow is when a diagnosis of Leukaemia is suspected and a Bone Marrow Trephine (A large bore needle is introduced into the hip bone and the marrow sucked out for investigation) is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Not a very savoury picture. Now, my friends who are Gastro-Intestinal Surgeons would always long for a nice bowl of Kway Chap (Pork Innards) after performing surgery, but I have never heard of Haematologists craving for Sup Tulang after performing Bone Marrow Trephine. I must say I did not think much of it. The taste was a bit like Soup Kambing (Mutton Soup) but a bit sweeter and thicker and it was really
in color such that you get all your fingers stained while eating it. I agree with Bourdain that the plastic fork they provided was absolutely useless (I mean these guys eat with their hands, the fork is probably only a nice gesture for us other folks who use utensils) Well, what’s there to say? Been there, done that and still left wondering what the fuss was all about! Maybe it was fasting month and the cook did not manage to taste the food or maybe its just that I did not like to perform a Bone Marrow Trephine with my mouth. Don’t know.

Maybe one of these days I would learn to like this stuff. Until then I give it
. But since it is both a Legend and something
ate, you might just want to try it yourself, if only to prove me wrong."

Queenstown Poh Pia Stall,"Commonwealth Cresecent Food Centre, Singapore","
Opening hours:
10:00AM to 10:00PM",97816307,,"Poh Piah is like the ultimate side dish for most of us. Almost everytime I visit a FC, I get tempted to buy just that one or two Poh Piah to put on the table.
This montage is for those of you who have never seen Poh Piah skin being made. Ever wonder if they make it this way commercially? Think about it. Almost every FC sells Poh Piah, but where did all the skin come from? If you are interested, head to the 2nd floor of Margaret Drive Food Centre and you can see it being made. Basically, the guy puts his whole hand into a big vat of gooey flour mix, and just slaps it onto a hot griddle, then deftly retracts his hand leaving the thin Poh Piah skin on the griddle. Repeat it a few hundred times and you would build the leaning tower of Poh Piah pictured above.
The other main ingredient is of course the braised turnip. It is the chinese turnip that gives the Poh Piah its distinctive taste. You don’t appreciate this stuff till you go overseas. When I was in Australia, you can’t find chinese turnips, so most restaurants substitute shredded lettuce for turnips when making spring rolls. Not the same yah? A really nice turnip filling is sweet, savoury and really satisfying.
This particular stall was featured in AsiaOne as one of 4 best Poh Piah stalls in Singapore. I think it’s because it’s one of the few that makes their own skin. The filling is your classic, sweet sauce, chilli, braised turnip, bean sprouts, eggs and the best bits, the crunchy sweet thingy. Some stalls use peanut to substitute, but that just does not cut it. You need this mysterious, crunchy sweet thingy.

Good, I give it
, but I just can’t help thinking how this could be so much better. I think that hawkers should seriously rethink and reinvent hawker food in Singapore. Just like what we did with
and
. All I did was to suggest the idea to the stallowners and they were willing to experiment with it. Now both items are doing so well that I won’t be surprised if other hawkers start copying them. We are not talking about a quantum leap, just the next step in the evolution of an old favourite. In the Da Pao scenario, all we did was take the humble pau, increase the size (like those in Malaysia) and add really nice stuff like salted eggs and lup cheong. With Sirloin Steak Satay, we increased the size and use a better cut of beef. Why can’t we do it with Poh Piah? The fact is that there are many people like you and me out there who want better stuff and are willing to pay just a bit more for it. Now, if you are a Poh Piah seller, this is my fantasy Poh Piah. Make it bigger! Add extra crunchy thingy, add Crispy Pork Floss, Black Sesame Seeds, Nice King Prawns and XO lup cheong in your Poh Piah and I will come and eat it and maybe take a few pictures. And if you are reading this blog and happen to know a hawker somewhere who is passionate about their food and willing to take the next evolutionary step, go ahead and encourage them, give them your wildest ideas and tell us all about it! We would all benefit from a hawker food revolution! For those who want to have their own Poh Piah Party, they sell a $50 set which includes everything needed to make 40 Poh Piahs.

Those of you who don’t like to hear me rave better stop reading because this is one place you MUST visit if you call yourself a true foodie! OK, so I am a Teochew Sua Gu from Swatow (Teochew Ignoramus from Swatow Province in China). This Teochew Ngo Hiang stall has been in existence since the current owner was only 11 years old. (He’s almost 60 now) Started by Mr Tan’s father, this stall IS already very famous! I mean, they got a newspaper cutting dating back to 1986 by Margaret Chan already declaring them to be the best Teochew Ngo Hiang in town! What have my parents been depriving me all these years?
After the dissappointing Ngo Hiang at Lavender FC where all the stuff was bought from the supplier, I was really elated to find some Teochew Ah Chiks and Ah Sohs (Uncles and Aunties) busily wrapping Ngo Hiang at Lao Zhong Zhong. Now there are times when being Hou Lian (Proud) and Ngerng (Stubborn) can be an asset and this is definitely one of those times. All the Teochew eateries that I have sampled so far have revealed a common personality trait among the famous Teochew food sellers. They are all Hou Lian and Ngerng when it comes to their food. They just feel that it is their God given duty to produce quality food for their customers. Click
to read about the other Teochew eateries. One of the reasons that that Mr Tan has refused to buy from suppliers is, aside from the poorer quality, the fact that most of the Ngo Hiang that you eat is the Hokkien style Ngo Hiang.(No proper Teochew Ah Chik would want to sell Hokkien Ngo Hiang, OK?) “What’s the difference?” I hear you ask. Plenty. First we Teochews tend to use lots of waterchestnuts in our cooking. So they add liberal quantities of waterchestnuts in their prawn rolls and waterchestnut slices. We Teochews also love Yam (Or Nee is Teochew) so they add yam into their Pork Rolls. (The last time I had yam laden pork rolls was in Bangkok where there is a huge Teochew community) The chilli is not overly spicy and is made of sweet plum sauce, sesame oil, black vinegar and peanuts. I don’t usually like the chilli, preferring the sweet sauce. BUT this one is really Phwaaa Sayah! (Unexpressibly delicious)
Of the 10 odd items, only the Tau Hoo is bought from the supplier. They even make their own Pork Sausages from pork thigh meat. The crispy prawn fritter is so light and crispy that it just melts in your mouth after the first bite! Dipped into the sweet, spicy and tangy chilli…..
This Heh Chor (Prawn Roll) is definitely the World’s 2nd Best (World best dunno where). Full of crunchy and sweet waterchestnuts, if you are feeling a little depressed, just eat 2 of these and guarantee you feel better. The Ngo Hiang (Meat Roll) is pork mixed with yam and has that subtle sweet flavour mixed in with the savoury pork and five spices. Phwaa Say! They are also famous for their Lo Mei Squid, though I did not know how to appreciate them.
Another item you just have to save up calories for is this Waterchestnut slice. It is made of egg, flour, waterchestnut and pork lard. Not for those with cholesterol problems (Maybe you should take some
with this meal yah?) But one bite of this and all your troubles seem so far away! MUST TRY!


What are you waiting for? The Jackson Centre will be closed in June 2007 and demolished to make way for a new tunnel so you better be quick or you’ll miss out on real Teochew style Ngo Hiang.
No need to say anymore.



PS: I have already given them instructions to inform me when they confirm their new stall location. So please check back next year for updates.

3.5/5","There is a recent welcomed resurrection of the handmade pau after a distressing period of time when it looked as if the factory made paus have all but eradicated this local favourite. But thankfully the Generation Xers (ie my age group) have rekindled the industry after being fed up with eating poorly disguised protein molasses wrapped in a synthetic skin. In order to differentiate themselves from the number of new handmade paus shops springing up everywhere, this unassuming little Pau Shop in Tampines started to make these XL sized pau three months ago. At first it was only made to order, but it proved so popular that now it is a standard item in their store. It’s not the most beautiful pau in the world but it never fails to impress the first time you behold one. You will invariably get two types of response. The food lovers can hardly wait to sink their teeth into one. More petite ones would be frightened/disgusted/appalled by the size of it. (This reaction is well worth the price of the pau) I call this a social pau. It’s meant to be shared. Imagine ordering 5 of this for an extended family picnic. Everyone gets to fight over who gets the salted egg, the sausages, mushrooms and egg. Ah….. family bonding.
When you break open the pau, you are immediately greeted with the savoury bouquet of juicy chunky meat, salted egg, mushrooms and chinese sausages. There is one whole egg and a whole salted egg yolk in each pau. Each pau is roughly equivalent to 8 standard sized char siew paus. The meat tastes very fresh and the salted egg, mushroom and chinese sausages combines very well with the meat. Its almost like a mobile claypot chicken rice sans rice. Unless you have a Godzilla sized appetite, this pau should comfortably feed 2 people. It costs $3.50 each. Considering the amount of special ingredients and the number of people it can feed, this is very good value for money. Shiokness Score

They also offer a novel Coffee Skin Tau Sar Pau (50 cents) which has quite an unique flavour. The Char Siew Pau (60 cents) is also quite good. The unique feature of this Pau shop is that the skin tastes very homemade, (its made from yeast rather then bicarbonate) much better then commercial type that you always get with factory made paus. Shiokness Score:

The Siew Mai is definitely tastier then your factory produced one. Don’t expect real roe on top for 50 cents each, but still worth trying. Shiokness Score

What’s there to say? If you have not eaten this before, go get one and watch your family/friends’/colleagues’ jaw drop. It’s worth $3.50 even if you just use it to scare someone."

Oh, you mean the Shanghainese were around 30 years ago! Ah Soh Des Ka! Started by Sebastian’s father over 30 years ago, the food here has evolved into what I term as “SingShang” cuisine. Take for instance the Tom Yum soup pictured above, this is like Tom Yum meets Sharks Fin soup. It is thick and gooey like Shark’s Fin soup but it has the chillies, lemon grass, galangal, lime flavours of Tom Yum. Whoever heard of Shanghai Tom Yum? Quite interesting. $4 per bowl (bigger bowl then picture above) (Ok, I realised that Tom Yum is Thai cuisine, but this is the SingThai version of Tom Yum, ok? Pedantic!)

The handmade Guo Tie deserves to be raved about. Crispy on the outside, juicy and savoury meat morsels on the inside AND you get 10 for $4!! Nothing better then good food then GOOD AND CHEAP food. Buy two plates and you will be very happy. Simple pleasures in life.

This is the Shanghai rice cake. It’s like hor fun, but instead of kway teow, you get what looks like sliced Marjong tiles. Its very chewy and supposedly, the yardstick in gauging its quality is how much of it gets stuck to your teeth. Good to try it once, but not really my cup of tea. (Don’t try it if your dentures are loose)

The steam dumplings are quite commendable, the main main selling point being real value for money. Not as tasty as Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure which are my favourite Shanghainese food places, but hey, $3 per plate, can’t complain, especially if you have a family of 10 mouths to feed.

I thought it was a good idea, so I visited Margaret Drive FC (Ok, you guys who complain I always blog food from the East, hey, I am listening!) yesterday and tasted some of the famous hawkers there. Over the next few days, I will post the few more notable stalls there. Today, I am excited to report on the famous Char Kway Teow (CKT) on the ground level of the FC. I haven’t had CKT for a while because I did not know any good ones and rather not “waste my calories” on lousy CKT. But this one had a long queue at 4.30pm!! So die, die, line up and try.
This Teochew Ah Chik has been frying CKT for 30 over years. Day in, day out. “Mai Hiam! Mai Ham! See You Joi! Mai Mee, Mai Ter Lah! (no chilli, no cockles, more black sauce, no noodles or pork lard). Phwa, talk about repetitive stress disorder! But this man seems to be enjoying himself quite a bit. So I asked why his CKT is so good. “I don’t know” he says. You see, the conundrum about CKT is that the ingredients are very basic. Put in the lard oil and fry some garlic. Add kway teow, noodles, bean sprouts, fish sauce and stir fry. Add some water, stir fry some more, add black sauce and chilli, stir fry some more, add cockles (oops, you don’t want cockles ah?) and serve. What secret is there? I joked with him that it must be his special kanabee (body odour).
No wonder people line up. This is be BEST kway teow I have eaten in years. (OK hold your horses, I only ate about 5 plates in the last few years). The taste is just right. Its got that nice savoury flavour mixed with a tinge of sweetness and just the right amount of fish sauce that you can’t taste the fish sauce itself. A mouthful of noodles plus the occasional lard bit (Please read disclaimer), Phwaa Sayah! I die a happy man.
For those who love See Harm, see the amount I got for $2.50! Too bad I don’t take See Harm.
Good enough to spend some precious calories and cholesterol points on! Eat it before the government decides to upgrade the FC. Once he is transplanted into a new environment I am afraid he would lose that “I have be here for over 30 years” taste!

Wednesdays",,,"Remember eating Hokkien Mee when you were a kid? Assuming you are my age, then you might have been eating from this particular store which has been around for 40 years. What they say about practise makes perfect is very true. This is one excellent hokkien mee particularly if you like your hokkien mee with thin bee hoon and swimming in thick gravy.
And if you like chilli, this particular chilli will make sure you return again and again. Mr Toh tells me that there are dried anchovies and dried prawns in the chlli. A secret receipe handed down from father to son. In fact, uncle was so passionate about the chilli that at one stage I was wondering if he was selling chilli, with Hokkien Mee as the condiment. I usually don’t take my hokkien mee with chilli, but today I was lapping it up.

What’s better then a mouthful of shiokalicious Hokkien Mee? A mouthful of shiokalicious Hokkien Mee with a piece of perfectly grilled Sio Bak, that’s what! If you have not tried this before, you are being deprived of one of the very simple (sinful) pleasures in life. When you put the noodles and the Sio Bak in your mouth, the first thing you that delights you is the crunch of the pork rind followed by a burst of flavour as the juices from the pork combine perfectly with the savoury gravy of the hokkien mee. And as you savour the taste, you can also appreciate the “pang” (tasty savoury smell) smell when you exhale through your nose. This excellent Sio Bak was purchased from Fatty Cheong’s who are also in the same FC. (That’s another blog)
Different style of Hokkien Mee from
. Chilli definitely wins Kim’s. Noodles wise, Kim’s is a little more QQ and has less gravy then Yi Sheng. Hard fight. Both are good in their own ways but I just feel that Yi Sheng just lacks that knockout punch. For the chilli lovers, that knockout punch might just be the chilli.

Definitely one of the best Hokkien Mee in Singapore and definitely better then Nam Sing Hokkien Mee which made it in the Makansutra Hawker Legends list."

Within this shop is also an excellent Teochew Porridge place where they cook all your dishes on the spot. Seems like this is a happening place for late night supper. They are opened 11am to 2am."

: 16 Oct 2006: This is the new supply of chilled NZ ribeye. $12.50 I did not think it looked very Ribeyeish in that it did not have the ball of fat in the middle and the nice tender bits around it. It was tender but not that beefy in taste but definitely more juicy. Aiya, I still liked the very first one, ie the first pic. But some initial positive feedback has been trickling in since he switched to chilled beef. You can find it

3.5/5","He differentiates his satay by making it extra big and full of chuncky chicken pieces. I was already quite happy with his satay, but this time round he decided that the ultimate chicken satay should also contain pieces of chicken skin to ensure that this is the most juicy and flavoursome satay. And the result is incredible. See for yourself!"
